# Fix for ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT Error

## The Problem
Your browser is blocking the API requests with `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`. This is typically caused by:

1. **Ad Blockers** (most common)
2. **Browser Security Settings**
3. **Content Security Policy**

## Quick Solutions

### Solution 1: Disable Ad Blocker (Fastest)
1. **Disable your ad blocker** for localhost
2. **Add localhost to whitelist** in your ad blocker settings
3. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Solution 2: Use Different Port (Alternative)
If ad blockers are the issue, try running on a different port:

```bash
# Stop current server
# Then run:
PORT=8080 node server.js
```

Then update your HTML files to use `http://localhost:8080/api/products`

### Solution 3: Browser Settings
1. **Chrome**: Go to Settings → Privacy and Security → Site Settings → localhost → Allow
2. **Firefox**: Go to about:config → search for "block" → disable blocking
3. **Edge**: Go to Settings → Privacy → Block trackers → Add localhost to exceptions

### Solution 4: Test in Incognito/Private Mode
Try opening your website in **incognito/private mode** - this often bypasses ad blockers.

## Server is Working ✅
- ✅ MongoDB connection: Working
- ✅ API endpoints: Responding correctly
- ✅ CORS: Fixed and configured
- ✅ Server: Running on port 3000

## Next Steps
1. Try **Solution 1** first (disable ad blocker)
2. If that doesn't work, try **Solution 4** (incognito mode)
3. If still blocked, use **Solution 2** (different port)

The issue is NOT with your code - it's a browser/security blocking issue!
